## What is this website about?

Well, nothing really works out =)), it simply serves the author for a few personal purposes as follows:

- Save all the knowledge you have learned for easy reference when you forget.
- Share programming experience with friends and relatives.
- Gossip, talk about life.
- In short, this is where I store everything in the world but mostly it revolves around the life of a coder and of course it is rewarding.
